Chat with Websites using Streamlit and LangChain
This project integrates Streamlit, LangChain, and other tools to create a chatbot interface for interacting with websites. The chatbot utilizes natural language processing and AI-driven text analysis to provide dynamic responses based on user queries and website content.

Features
Web Scraping and Document Analysis: Utilizes BeautifulSoup for web scraping and LangChain for document loading and analysis.
Conversational AI: Implements ChatOpenAI from LangChain for generating human-like responses to user queries.
Interactive Interface: Users can input queries via a Streamlit-based interface, with responses dynamically updated based on the chat history and website context.
Technologies Used
Streamlit: Python framework for building interactive web applications.
LangChain: Python library for natural language processing and AI-driven text analysis.
BeautifulSoup: Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents.
OpenAI GPT-3: AI model used for generating human-like text responses.
